# ARC-AGI Dataset Evaluation

This directory contains experiments for evaluating the current compositional program synthesis system on the ARC-AGI datasets.

## Files

- **`test_arc_agi_samples.py`** - Main script for testing ARC-AGI tasks
  - Tests ALL tasks from both ARC-AGI 1 and ARC-AGI 2 datasets (1,920 total)
  - Validates task compatibility (single-color output format `[[N]]`)
  - Provides detailed statistics and breakdowns by dataset
  - Reports incompatible tasks separately from unsolved tasks
  
- **`arc_agi_all_results.json`** - Complete results from testing all 1,920 tasks
  - Generated by `test_arc_agi_samples.py`
  - Contains detailed task-by-task results and summary statistics

## Usage

From the project root directory:

```bash
cd experiments/arc_agi_evaluation
python test_arc_agi_samples.py
```

The script will:
1. Load all 1,920 tasks from ARC-AGI 1 and ARC-AGI 2 datasets
2. Check each task for compatibility with our system (single-color outputs)
3. Run program synthesis on compatible tasks
4. Generate `arc_agi_all_results.json` with detailed results

## Task Compatibility

The system is designed for tasks that output a single color value (format `[[N]]`). The script automatically:
- Validates task compatibility before attempting program synthesis
- Reports incompatible tasks separately
- Calculates success rates only among compatible tasks

## Results Summary

Based on the latest experimental run:

- **Total tasks tested**: 1,920 (ARC-AGI 1 & 2 combined)
- **Compatible tasks**: Tasks with single-color outputs (`[[N]]` format)
- **Incompatible tasks**: Tasks requiring full grid transformations
- **Success rate**: Percentage of compatible tasks that our system can solve
- **Detailed breakdown**: Per-dataset statistics for compatibility and solvability

All results are saved to `arc_agi_all_results.json` for detailed analysis.
